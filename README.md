##  ---- To Do List ----


1. Before inputing player names the tic-tac-toe crossword is reaching the edge of its containing div. Best solution is probably to make the board invisible until both user names are input.

2. Put in a reset game button for after a player wins rather than having to click on a firework.

3. Put in some sort of animation to let user know when they have had a draw game.

4. Better indication of who is X and who is O
